# LyraPhase SSH Baseline InSpec Profile

This Compliance profile inherits from the [DevSec SSH Baseline][1]
InSpec profile.

Some controls are ignored because those OpenSSH features are useful and
convenient.

## Standalone Usage

This Compliance Profile requires [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) for execution:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LyraPhase/ssh-baseline
inspec exec ssh-baseline
```

You can also execute the profile directly from Github:

```bash
inspec exec https://github.com/LyraPhase/ssh-baseline
```
